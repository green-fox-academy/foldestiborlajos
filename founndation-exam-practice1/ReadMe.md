    All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

What can I use?

    You can use any resource online, but please work individually
    Don't just copy-paste your answers and solutions, use your own words instead.
    Don't push your work to GitHub until your mentor announces that the time is up

4. Question time! (~10 mins) [4p]
Name each building block of a method! [2p]

anatomy
Your answer:


1.declaration of a method;<br>
2.return type;<br>
3.name of the method;<br>
4.type of input parameter of method;<br>
5.name of the input parameter;<br>
6.counter, what the method will give back;<br>
7.body of the method;<br>
8.return statement, that gives back value of sum;<br>

A constructor is a method. It is used to instantiate a given class.<br>
Basically it tells how an instance object of a class should be built up.<br>
When we instanciate a new object the statements last part calls the constructor:<br>
eg. ArrayList example = new Arraylist(); the Arraylist() at the end is the constuctor;<br>
A constructor is declared in the class. A class can have multiple constructor.<br>
A constructor is declared in the following way.<br>
acsess modifier(default: acessable in the same package),<br>
name, that must match with the class's name, <br>
list of parameters, according to an instance should be constructed (default empty),<br>
body of the constructor, where we can declare how an instance object should look like<br>.
<eg. what values variable in the object's field the instance should have><br>;
if we don't declare a constructor to a class, the default is the empty<br>;
