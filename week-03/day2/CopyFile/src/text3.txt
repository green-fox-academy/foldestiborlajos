Lambda calculus (also written as λ-calculus) is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing
computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution.
It is a universal model of computation that can be used to simulate any Turing machine.
 It was first introduced by mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s as part of his research of
  the foundations of mathematics.

Lambda calculus consists of constructing lambda terms and performing reduction operations on them.
In the simplest form of lambda calculus, terms are built using only the following rules:
