            <p> The Domain Name System delegates the responsibility of assigning domain names 
              and mapping those names to Internet resources by designating authoritative name 
              servers for each domain. Network administrators may delegate authority over 
              sub-domains of their allocated name space to other name servers. This mechanism 
              provides distributed and fault-tolerant service 
              and was designed to avoid a single large central database.  </p>

            <h2>The Internet maintains two principal namespaces </h2>
            <p>   The Internet maintains two principal namespaces, the domain name hierarchy[1] and the Internet Protocol (IP) address spaces.[2]
                The Domain Name System maintains the domain name hierarchy and provides translation services between it and the address spaces. </p>

          <li class="list">
            <h2>Function</h2>
            <p> An often-used analogy to explain the Domain Name System is that it
                 serves as the phone book for the Internet by translating human-friendly computer hostnames into IP addresses. 
                 For example, the domain name www.example.com translates to the addresses
                 93.184.216.34 (IPv4) and 2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946 (IPv6). The DNS can be quickly and transparently updated,</p>
